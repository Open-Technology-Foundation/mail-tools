Phone: +50482928421Hello,   I have a PT PMA that I am the director; which is an online real estate platform.  I’d like to know if I can do the following: - 1 work permit IMTA + Visa Kitas under my PMA  - 1 work permit IMTA under another real estate company hiring me as a consultant / agent.   Is it possible to have two IMTA and only one Kitas?  Some people say yes, other no so I’d like to hire a professional company who knows what they do.   As I need to work as an agent for the other real estate company (I have no share in their company);  But still need to keep my own PMA and be able to develop our online platform.   Thank you in advance!
