Hello. My wife and I would like  to get more information and would like to get the process started on being able to live in Bali. We would like to build a couple of villas for tourists or maybe a restaurant/bar .   Do we become citizens 1st? Or do we purchase a business 1st?  And final question, am I allowed to open a bank account in Bali ? Thank you üôèüèº  Sam
