Hi Rahmat,

Can you quote me to do my taxes yearly.

So this will include 3 properties which i am receiving a monthly rental, to
be submitted and paid monthly
This will also include my pbb tax on land which is for 4 properties (3 from
above and 1 which is only land), per year.
Any other tax I need to pay or submit per year including my annual personal
tax return.

Thanks

    <p>Dear Firas Bawazir,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your
      information. Based on your situation, you obtained your <strong>KTP, =
KK, and NPWP</strong> in
      2023.</p>
    <p>Your main source of
      income currently comes from the properties registered under your
      name.</p>
    <p>In Indonesia, income
      from renting out a house through <strong>Airbnb</strong> falls under =
the category of <strong>rental income from property</strong>,
      which is generally subject to <strong>Final Income Tax (PPh Final)</s=
trong> at a <strong>rate of 10%</strong>.</p>
    <p>Regarding tax payments,
      you are required to <strong>pay
        monthly</strong> if you receive rental income on a monthly
      basis. However, if there is no rental income in a given month, you
      are <strong>not required</strong>
      to submit or pay the tax for that period. At the end of the fiscal
      year, you will only need to file your <strong>annual personal tax ret=
urn</strong>, as the tax
      has already been paid monthly.</p>
    <p>If you need further
      clarification, we can arrange an <strong>online consultation</strong>=
. Our fee for a <strong>1-hour consultation</strong>
      is <strong>IDR 3.6 million</strong>.</p>
    <p>Please let us know if

              residency status, source of income, and any applicable tax
              treaties. I understand that receiving mixed information
              can be confusing, and I=E2=80=99d be glad to help clarify you=
r tax
              requirements.<br>
              <br>
              To provide you with the best guidance, could you share
              more details about your income sources and how long you
              have been living outside Indonesia? This will help me
              determine the specific regulations that apply to your
              situation.<br>
              <br>
              Looking forward to your response.<br>

                  I want to inquire if you could help me with my
                  personal tax reporting, i am somewhat of an unusual
                  case, i am an Indonesian that does not live in
                  Indonesia and i am a bit confused on what is required
                  of me and i am getting mixed information from
                  different sources. <br>
                  <br>
                  Let me know if this is something you have experience
                  in. <br>
                  <br>
                  Thanks</div>
