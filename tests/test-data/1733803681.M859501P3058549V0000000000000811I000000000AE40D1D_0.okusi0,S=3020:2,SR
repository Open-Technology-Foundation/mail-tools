Phone: +61428153036Hi,  I may be asked to establish a Representative Office for an Australian Office in Indonesia for marketing purposes. Could you please inform me of the following:  1. The legal cost of establishing the Office. 2. Your costs for assisting in this matter. 3. Can an Australian receive a KITAS to run the Representative Office. (while there are no guarantees for me, I am an Australian married to an Indonesian - we live in Australia - would it be easier for me to get a Spouse visa in this instance)  Over time, we may want to establish a college (not university) - is a Yayasan required for this.  Kind regards,  James Bartle
