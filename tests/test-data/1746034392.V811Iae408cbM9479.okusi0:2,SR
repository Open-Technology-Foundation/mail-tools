Hello,   We are in the process of establishing a managed services offering at Diligent, which will involve supporting clients with their global entity management. As the leading provider of board solutions, this is an exciting time for the business.    As part of this process, we are looking to establish strong relationships with in-country specialists who can support us in providing a high-quality corporate secretarial service to our clients. I would be grateful if you could confirm pricing and scope to provide support with the basic annual compliance requirements a company has each year in Indonesia, for example, preparation of documents to approve the financial statements and filing at the local registry, and maintenance of the statutory registers.    I would also be happy to arrange an introductory call.    Kind regards,   Jenny
