I am writing to inquire about the process of establishing a company in Indonesia, particularly regarding ownership regulations, nominee structuring, and legal compliance for foreign investors.  We intend to explore opportunities within special economic zones such as Batam or Morowali. We are seeking guidance on the most suitable business entity type for foreign ownership (e.g., PT PMA), Legal limits or conditions on foreign shareholding, Available options for nominee arrangements (if required), Regulatory and licensing requirements, Visa and work permit processes for directors or staff, and Taxation and repatriation considerations.  We also want to understand how your firm can assist with ongoing compliance and advisory services. Please let us know a suitable time for an initial consultation or share your service brochure and fee structure if available.
