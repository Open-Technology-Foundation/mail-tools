Hello Okusi. My name is Stelianos Athan. I have used your services before and thought perhaps you might have a solution I havent pursued. I am a family KITAS holder (sponsored by my Indonesian wife - domicile is in Bali although currently working in Jakarta). I wish to convert to a KITAP but as I am always working away from home I it difficult to execute. My understanding is there is a requirement to stay at the registered domicile for 3 months in waiting for random visit and interview by authorities. Is this really the case, and is there a work-around for this? Id love to hear back from you to see what your thoughts are. Thanks.
