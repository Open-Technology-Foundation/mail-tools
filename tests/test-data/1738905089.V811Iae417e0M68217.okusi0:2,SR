Phone: +6597887127Hi, may I know if Okusi Associates provide PSAK to IFRS adjusting journal entries services? Currently our company is involved in a joint venture in Indonesia and has a PT PMA JV project company. We need to review the project companys financial statements quarterly for consolidation in IFRS standard but the JV companys monthly report are only created in PSAK standard. Do provide let us know if such services are available and kindly send us a quotation for reference. Thank you.
