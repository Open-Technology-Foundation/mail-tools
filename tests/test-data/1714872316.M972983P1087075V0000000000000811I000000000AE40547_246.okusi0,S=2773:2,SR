Please can you advise the process for extending the E33E Visa after the initial 5 year period including the cost, any rules relating to the extension, processing time and if the Visa is renewed within Indonesia or do you have to leave Indonesia to action the extension.  Also, on your website it states that you need to deposit $50,000 USD but can you advise if this amount is per person or if it is a different amount for a married couple.  Could you also advise how much monthly income is required for a married couple.  Kind Regards  Sally Hanbury
