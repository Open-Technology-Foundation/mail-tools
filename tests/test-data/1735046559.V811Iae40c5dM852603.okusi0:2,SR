Phone: +6587771819Hi, I am interested to find out the following: 1. registration in Batam a private limited company - does this count as the company is an Indonesian registered company ? 2. is there a need for resident director under the Indonesian Companys Act. 3. What is the annual fees for corporate secretary and what are the responsibilities ? 4. Can you share with me what other the documents required and if the registration can be done remotely. Thank you.
