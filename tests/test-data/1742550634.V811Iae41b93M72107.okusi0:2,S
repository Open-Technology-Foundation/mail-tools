Hi Rahmat,

Thanks for getting back to me

I will try to explain my situation as briefly as possible:

   - I have lived all my life outside of Indonesia, my father is indonesian
   (from jakarta) and my mother is Saudi. I lived/live in Saudi Arabia all =
my
   life
   - I only carry an indonesian passport, i do not carry any other
   nationalities
   - In 2023 i decided to purchase property in bali, to be able to do so i
   had to go to jakarta and get 3 things (i did not have this before), my K=
TP,
   my KK and my NPWP
   - Once i got those i invested in a few properties in bali and lombok
   which are being rented out on Airbnb
   - I do not have a job in saudi, my main source of income now are the
   properties (which are under my personal name not a company)
   - I have spoken to many people previously, and they informed me that i
   am only liable to pay a yearly fee on my income from my properties @ 10%=
,
   which is also what i have read online through many sources.
   - Now in 2024 I submitted my tax through a company which initially
   informed me that I have to do this yearly but now is telling me that I h=
ave
   to do it monthly which i'm not sure is right due to the mixed informatio=
n
   I'm getting from this company. They are saying ''WHT of rental applies t=
o
   both individual entrepreneurs and companies, so i have to report it
   monthly. Which i feel defeats the purpose of reporting my personal incom=
e
   yearly.

Let me know if you need any additional information

Thanks
