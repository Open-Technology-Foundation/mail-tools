Phone: +61427227977Hello,  I am looking at setting up additional PT PMA companies (2-3) in Indonesia.  You guys set up my original company in 2006, PT Environeer.  If you can send through the details.  The number above is for Whatsapp.  Is there an issue with using one address (same as original company) for the new companies short term?  Location would be Surabaya/East Java.    Thanks.
