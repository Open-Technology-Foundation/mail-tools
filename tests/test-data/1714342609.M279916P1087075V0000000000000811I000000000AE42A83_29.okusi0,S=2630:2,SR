Phone: +6581235022Dear Team  I would like to understand your PMA setup offering. In my situation, Id like complete shares of the said PMA to be held by a legal entity (a company domiciled in Singapore). I do have a director and legal Bali address for use, please advise on documentation and approvals needed, if any.  If its easier to discuss in person, I am in Bali at the moment and do have availability tomorrow (26, 29, and 30 April). Contact as above.  Best, Amb
