Dear Okusi Associates,  Greetings from cbs Malaysia. My name is Safwan.  For your kind information, cbs is a global IT consulting company, and we are currently exploring the possibility of temporarily placing employees from our Malaysia office to Jakarta, Indonesia for work related to client arrangements. These assignments are expected to last for approximately 10 to 12 months. This temporary placement pertains specifically to their work responsibilities.  We would be grateful if you could confirm your company offers visa or work permit services that could assist us in ensuring our employees comply with Indonesian employment law for such temporary assignments.  Thank you for your time and assistance with this important matter.  With kind regards.
