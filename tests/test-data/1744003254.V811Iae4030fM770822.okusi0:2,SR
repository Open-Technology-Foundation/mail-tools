Phone: +918220848612I am an Indian National, aged about 80 years, would like to get Silver Hair visa for me and my wife aged about 74 ears. Kindly advise the way forward to obtain this visa in the most economical way, indicating your charges too.  Please confirm if I can buy a property in Indonesia while living under this Visa E33E, or may I buy a property equivalent to $50,000 instead of depositing in a government bank. Thank you.
