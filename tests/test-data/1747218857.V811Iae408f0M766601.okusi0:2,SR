Phone: +917708667888Dear Team,  My name is Sathish, and I am reaching out from India to request your assistance in verifying the business details of a company registered as CV JCW Group, based in Badung, Bali.  Recently, a fraudulent international transaction was made using my Indian credit card, and the merchant name recorded was IFP*CV JCW GROUP, Badung Kab. with the Merchant Category Code 4722 (Travel Agencies & Tour Operators). I have reported this to my local cybercrime cell, and investigations are ongoing. However, to expedite the process and explore legal options in Indonesia, I would like to verify the legitimacy, ownership, and contact details of this company.  Specifically, I would like your assistance with:  1. Verifying the legal registration of CV JCW Group with the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights (AHU).   2. Obtaining their official business address, contact number, and representative details.   3. If possible, identifying the bank account or payment process
 or involved in receiving the funds.    Please let me know your professional fee, required documents, and the expected timeline for this request. Your assistance in this matter means a lot to me, as this involves my hard-earned money and a possible case of international financial fraud.  Looking forward to your response.  Warm regards, Sathish
