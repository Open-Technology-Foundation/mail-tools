Phone: 81282521396I am currently on an investors kitas. I am attempting to switch to a work Visa. The EPO was rejected. I hired an agent with more experience, it has also been rejected (because they rejected me before).  How am I supposed to legally close my Investors Kitas and Begin working legally?
