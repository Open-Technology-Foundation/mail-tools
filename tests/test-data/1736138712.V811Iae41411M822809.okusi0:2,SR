To whom it may concern,  I hope this message finds you well. My name is Lourdgene Howes and I am reaching out for assistance regarding a situation that occurred during my recent visit to Bali.  I underwent a massage at a local five-star resort spa in Ubud, after which I developed significant muscle pain and began struggling to walk. Following medical evaluation, including an MRI, I was diagnosed with muscle strain and myositis and it was indicated by my Orthopedic doctor that the massage may have contributed to this condition. This happened on the 6 November 2024, was in the hospital twice and I was admitted for 6 days in the hospital. Until now, I am still using a walking stick to walk and cannot go to work.   Given the circumstances, I would like to explore my legal options against the spa for potential negligence. I am seeking a reputable, English-speaking lawyer in Bali with experience handling personal injury or consumer negligence cases involving tourists.  If you can recommend
  a trusted lawyer or legal firm, I would greatly appreciate your guidance. I am prepared to provide all medical records, receipts, and a detailed account of the events for their review.  Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Sincerely,  Lourdgene Howes
