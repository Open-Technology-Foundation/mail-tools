Phone: +390399281112Dear manager, Our branch wants to open a company in Indonesia. Our company deals with the construction of industrial plants especially in the chemical sector. We already have another company in Singapore and we would like to start a stable business in your country. I am not clear on the difference between Local Company and Foreign company, if you could give me some more information I would be grateful. Stefano Rossi
