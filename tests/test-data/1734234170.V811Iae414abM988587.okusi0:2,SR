Phone: 8111435111Hi,  I am currently living and working in Indonesia. I have a company sponsored KITAS and my family is on dependent KITAS. However in April 24 my contract with my company will end and they will not renew or extend my contract. I intend to continue staying in Indonesia however I will probably not have a job for some time. I would like to understand as to how can I and my family continue living and working in Indonesia without a work KITAS
